This is important to understand. 

Every row in Bootstrap has 12 units of space to divvy up.

So if we have 4 columns, and one row, then each row will contain
about 3 units. 

If we have 3 columns, each row will contain 4 units.

If we have two columns, each row will contain 6units. 

If we have only one column, the column (with one row) will contain 
exactly 12units.
